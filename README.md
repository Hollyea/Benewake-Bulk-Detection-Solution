Volume Detection System Introduction
In order to obtain accurate inventory balance and meet the needs of large enterprise data information management, reliable and fast volume inspection becomes particularly important. Benewake volume detection system, based on high performance single-point LiDAR, has a maximum detection range of 180m @90% reflectivity. With two steering gears, this system has a large FoV of 120°*120°, so it can be used to build the point cloud of silo, coal pile, bunker, etc.. And integrated with self-developed algorithm, this system has a high accuracy, the detection error is less than 1%. 


**Measurement Unit** --- TF03 (Optional dust brush) × 1  Steering gear × 2

The measurement unit consists of one TF03 and support structure with two steering gear. It can scan multiple lines along the X and Y axes through the steering gear system, and use TF03 to obtain point cloud data in real time. With two steering gears expanding the scanning range of the LiDAR, the FoV of the system is up to 120 °* 120 °. 


**Main Control Unit ** --- Built-in volume calculating algorithm

3D point cloud model is composed of distance and coordinates. After the main control board obtains real-time point cloud data, it can quickly calculate the volume value through the built-in algorithm and transmit it to the customer monitoring center through wireless network.
